# agent-step-toolkit plugin changelog

Version history for the **plugin package** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + the marketplace entry) —
the skills, templates, references, and workflows the plugin ships.

This is distinct from [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), which tracks only the **vendored agent-step
runner library** version (`skills/create-tool/templates/agent-step/VERSION`, bumped by `/bump-version`).
A plugin release may or may not include a library bump.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); newest first. Semver on the plugin:
**major** = removed/renamed skill or breaking workflow change, **minor** = new skill / capability /
template, **patch** = doc or fix with no new surface.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Ships agent-step runner library **1.1.0** — native read pagination via the `pageable` action opt
  (the runner injects `page`/`pageSize`, returns a uniform envelope, and caches the full set in the
  library-managed `pagedRead` slot). See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and
  [migrations/1.0.0-to-1.1.0.md](migrations/1.0.0-to-1.1.0.md).
- `create-tool` pagination reconciled to the library opt: `executor-read-paginated.ts.template` now
  uses `pageable`; the hand-rolled `reslice-cache.ts.template` from 0.4.0 is **removed**
  (`querySignature` is now a library export); the `pagedRead` library-managed slot is added to the
  bootstrap state template; references/workflows updated; the bootstrap `test` script runs
  `dist/agent-step/*.test.js` (runner + paginate).

### Notes
- Downstream projects pull the new library via `/pull-library` (additive; `pageable` is opt-in, so
  existing tools are unaffected).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Paginated-read support in `create-tool`.** New `executor-read-paginated.ts.template`
  (single-source paginated read in the per-action `Slice` shape: `page`/`pageSize` params, full rows
  → state, one bounded page → the model, optional reslice-cache) and `reslice-cache.ts.template`
  (`querySignature` helper). Generalized from a working agent-step read action.
- Result size is now a **prompted decision**, not just documented: the derivation checklist asks
  "large/list read → paginate?", the plan template surfaces it per read action, and the create-tool
  workflow picks the executor template by shape.

### Notes
- No library change — still vendors agent-step `1.0.0`. Downstream projects do **not** need
  `/pull-library`; the new templates apply only to newly-authored actions.

## [0.3.0]

- Vendored agent-step runner library **1.0.0** (per-action state selectors). See
  [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and [migrations/0.1.0-to-1.0.0.md](migrations/0.1.0-to-1.0.0.md).
- Self-contained test scaffolding (shared harness + per-tool sandbox / prompt-input templates),
  general references (identity patterns, read-tool patterns), and config-doc fixes.

## [0.2.0]

- Added library versioning skills: `/bump-version` (maintainer) and `/pull-library` (downstream).

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: `create-tool` (bootstrap + add-tool) and `test-agent-step` skills.
